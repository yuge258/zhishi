 * Hidden render provenance.
 *
 * HyperFrames stamps the *container* — never the picture — with the renderer
 * name and version, so a rendered file carries a machine-readable note about
 * what produced it, with no visible watermark burned into the frames.
 *
 * What goes in is deliberately boring: renderer name and version. No file
 * paths, usernames, machine names, project names or composition content. Once
 * a file is distributed the metadata travels with it, and metadata leaks are
 * hard to walk back.
 *
 * **An unauthenticated hint — not an authenticity or attribution boundary.**
 * These are ordinary unsigned container keys that any tool can write, so a
 * present tag means the file *claims* to be HyperFrames output, not that
 * HyperFrames produced it: one `ffmpeg -metadata hyperframes_renderer=...`
 * forges it. Absence proves just as little, since re-encoding, remuxing, or
 * any tool that drops unknown keys strips them, and files rendered before this
 * feature never had them. Good for diagnostics and support ("what wrote this
 * file?"); never a basis for trust, attribution or licensing decisions in
 * either direction. Verifiable provenance needs signed claims (C2PA), which
 * this deliberately is not.
