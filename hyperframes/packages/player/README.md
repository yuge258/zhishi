# @hyperframes/player

Embeddable web component for playing HyperFrames compositions. Zero dependencies, works with any framework.

## Install

```bash
npm install @hyperframes/player
```

Or load directly via CDN:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hyperframes/player"></script>
```

If you need a classic `<script>` tag instead of ESM, use the explicit global build:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hyperframes/player/dist/hyperframes-player.global.js"></script>
```

## Usage

```html
<hyperframes-player src="./my-composition/index.html" controls></hyperframes-player>
```

The player loads the composition in a sandboxed iframe, auto-detects its dimensions and duration, and scales it responsively to fit the container.

### With a framework

```typescript
import "@hyperframes/player";

// The custom element is now registered — use it in your markup
// React: <hyperframes-player src="..." controls />
// Vue:   <hyperframes-player :src="url" controls />
```

### Video files

Set `type` to a video type and the player plays `src` in a `<video playsinline>` instead of loading it as a composition. The same API and events apply: `play()`, `pause()`, `seek()`, `currentTime`, `duration`, `ready`, `timeupdate`, `play`, `pause`, `ended`, `durationchange` and `resize`, with the video's own size as `compositionWidth`/`compositionHeight`. A video that fails to load fires `error` at once with `{ message, code }`, where `code` is the `MediaError` code. A `play()` the browser blocks (for example, unmuted autoplay) fires `playbackerror` with `{ source: "video" }` and leaves the player paused. `poster`, `controls`, `loop`, `muted`, `volume`, `playback-rate` and `autoplay` work as they do for a composition. `scenes`, `setRuntimeData()`, `setColorGrading()`, `iframeElement` and `stopMedia()` are composition-only: a video has no scenes or runtime, its iframe stays blank, and `stopMedia()` does not stop the video. `srcdoc` wins over a video `src`, as it does in an iframe.

```html
<hyperframes-player
  type="video/mp4"
  src="./render.mp4"
  poster="./poster.jpg"
  controls
></hyperframes-player>
```

### Poster image

Show a static image before playback starts:

```html
<hyperframes-player
  src="./composition/index.html"
  poster="./thumbnail.jpg"
  controls
></hyperframes-player>
```

## Attributes

| Attribute               | Type                            | Default       | Description                                                                 |

| `poster`                | string                          | —             | Image URL shown before playback starts                                      |
| `playback-rate`         | number                          | 1             | Speed multiplier (0.5 = half, 2 = double)                                   |

| `loop`                  | boolean                         | false         | Restart when the composition ends                                           |
| `shader-capture-scale`  | number                          | —             | Shader transition snapshot scale forwarded to browser previews (`0.25`-`1`) |
| `shader-loading`        | `composition \| player \| none` | `composition` | Controls shader transition prep loading UI ownership                        |
| `assets-loading-ui`     | `player \| none`                | `player`      | `none` never shows the loading-assets card; asset events still fire         |
| `low-power-idle`        | boolean                         | false         | While paused, check in once a second, not every 80 ms (many-player pages)   |
| `disable-click-to-play` | boolean                         | false         | A click on the player no longer plays or pauses (host overlays own clicks)  |
| `range-start`           | number                          | —             | Film second where playback starts, loops back to and parks when paused      |
| `range-end`             | number                          | —             | Film second the range ends before: it stops or loops on the frame before it |

`range-start` and `range-end` play the moment [start, end) of the film. The player parks on `range-start` at `ready`, and again when a paused playhead falls outside a new range; `play()` from outside the range starts there. At the end it holds the last frame before `range-end` and fires `ended`, or wraps to `range-start` with `loop`. A current runtime stops on that frame itself; video and `__timelines` players stop on their next clock tick and step back to it; an older runtime stops when the player sees its time pass the end. `currentTime` and `duration` stay in film time. A range past the film is cut to its end and an empty or negative one is ignored; both fire `rangeclamped`.

### Shader transition previews

When a composition uses `@hyperframes/shader-transitions`, the player can own preview-only shader capture settings:

```html
<hyperframes-player
  src="./composition/index.html"
  shader-capture-scale="1"
  shader-loading="player"
  controls
></hyperframes-player>
```

`shader-loading="player"` shows the player-owned transition-prep overlay from shader progress messages. `composition` leaves direct composition fallback behavior alone, and `none` suppresses the loader.

### Loading-assets card

While images, video or fonts are still loading after `ready`, the player shows a loading card over the frame and sets the `assets-loading` attribute on itself. A host that draws its own loading state can turn the card off with `assets-loading-ui="none"` (or `player.assetsLoadingUi = "none"`). The `assets-loading` attribute and the `assetsready` and `painted` events behave the same either way, so the host still knows when the frame is ready.

### Audio lock (host-mandated silent playback)

`audio-locked` forces `muted` on and hides the volume controls, with no UI path for the viewer to turn sound back on. Use it when embedding in a chat host (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, etc.) where audio must stay off regardless of viewer intent. Setting `muted` directly is _not_ enough — viewers can flip it back via the controls bar.

Removing `audio-locked` only unhides the controls; it does **not** auto-unmute. Callers manage `muted` explicitly after unlocking.

**Host-environment fallback.** Some host renderers — notably the Claude desktop Electron client — strip unknown custom-element attributes before they reach the DOM, defeating the attribute. As a safety net, the player also self-imposes the lock when it detects such an environment via `navigator.userAgent`, so audio stays muted even if the attribute never arrives. The public `audioLocked` property still reflects only the attribute, so external consumers (e.g. host widgets that mirror state) are not affected by the fallback.

### Mobile audio

Mobile browsers block `audio.play()` inside iframes when the user gesture happened in the parent frame (the [User Activation spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#tracking-user-activation) does not propagate activation across frame boundaries via `postMessage`).

The player handles this automatically for same-origin iframes (the default — `sandbox` includes `allow-same-origin`):

1. When the composition is ready, the player extracts all timed media (`audio[data-start]`, `video[data-start]`) from the iframe DOM and creates parent-frame copies.
2. The iframe originals are disabled (`src` and `data-start` removed) so the runtime doesn't try to play them.
3. When `play()` is called (from a user gesture), parent media `.play()` runs synchronously in the gesture call stack, satisfying mobile autoplay policy.
4. Both parent media and the GSAP timeline start simultaneously and free-run — no active sync needed since both are real-time systems.

No changes are required by consumers — this works out of the box.

The optional `audio-src` attribute can be used to start preloading a primary audio track before the iframe loads (useful on slow connections), but is not required for mobile playback.

## JavaScript API

```js
const player = document.querySelector("hyperframes-player");

// Playback
player.play();
player.pause();
player.seek(2.5); // jump to 2.5 seconds

// Properties
player.currentTime; // number (read/write)
player.duration; // number (read-only)
player.paused; // boolean (read-only)
player.ready; // boolean (read-only)
player.compositionWidth; // number (read-only), the composition's width
player.compositionHeight; // number (read-only), the composition's height
player.disableClickToPlay; // boolean (read/write)
player.playbackRate; // number (read/write)
player.muted; // boolean (read/write)
player.audioLocked; // boolean (read/write) — force-mute + hide volume controls
player.loop; // boolean (read/write)
player.rangeStart; // number | null (read/write, mirrors range-start)
player.rangeEnd; // number | null (read/write, mirrors range-end)
player.shaderCaptureScale; // number (read/write)
player.shaderLoading; // "composition" | "player" | "none" (read/write)

// Inner iframe access (for advanced consumers — see "Advanced: iframe access" below)
player.iframeElement; // HTMLIFrameElement (read-only)
```

## Runtime data delivery

`setRuntimeData(channel, payload)` clones and retains the payload, then delivers it after the
composition runtime is ready. Invalid channels and non-cloneable payloads throw synchronously.
Failures after the call returns are reported with `runtimedataerror`; successful application is
reported with `runtimedataapplied`. Both events include `{ channel, requestId }`, and errors also
include `message`. Listen for both outcomes when delivery matters:

```js
player.addEventListener("runtimedataapplied", ({ detail }) => {
  console.log("applied", detail.channel, detail.requestId);
});
player.addEventListener("runtimedataerror", ({ detail }) => {
  console.error("not applied", detail.channel, detail.requestId, detail.message);
});
player.setRuntimeData("captions", captionData);
```

Only the latest in-flight update for a channel can emit a completion. A missing runtime response,
iframe teardown, or bridge delivery failure emits `runtimedataerror` instead of remaining pending
indefinitely.

## Advanced: iframe access

The composition runs inside a sandboxed `<iframe>` in the player's Shadow DOM. The default sandbox includes `allow-same-origin` for editor, recorder, and custom-timeline integrations that inspect the composition DOM. That is a trusted-content mode, not an isolation boundary: same-origin composition code can reach the embedding page.

For read-only or message-bridge integrations, set `sandbox-origin="opaque"`. Any non-null value is
treated as opaque so a typo cannot weaken isolation. Changing the attribute reloads the active
composition because browser sandbox changes take effect only on navigation. Opaque mode removes
`allow-same-origin` while retaining scripts, and prevents the composition from reading unrelated
parent DOM. Direct `contentDocument`, `__player`, and `__timelines` access is intentionally
unavailable in that mode.

If you are building a trusted editor integration that needs direct access, use the `iframeElement` getter:

```js
const player = document.querySelector("hyperframes-player");
const iframe = player.iframeElement;

// Now you can reach into the composition's DOM and runtime
iframe.contentDocument.querySelectorAll("[data-composition-id]");
iframe.contentWindow.__timelines;
```

This is the canonical way to bridge the player into tools like [`@hyperframes/studio`](../studio). The studio exports a `resolveIframe` helper that works with both iframe refs and web-component refs:

```ts
import { useTimelinePlayer, resolveIframe } from "@hyperframes/studio";

const { iframeRef } = useTimelinePlayer();
const player = document.createElement("hyperframes-player");
player.setAttribute("src", src);
container.appendChild(player);

// Forward the inner iframe so useTimelinePlayer can drive play/pause/seek.
iframeRef.current = resolveIframe(player);
```

### React: declarative ref pattern

If you prefer JSX over imperative element creation, attach a ref directly to the web component and resolve the iframe inside an effect:

```tsx
import "@hyperframes/player";
import type { HyperframesPlayer } from "@hyperframes/player";
import { useTimelinePlayer, resolveIframe } from "@hyperframes/studio";

function StudioPreview({ src }: { src: string }) {
  const { iframeRef, onIframeLoad } = useTimelinePlayer();
  const playerRef = useRef<HyperframesPlayer>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    iframeRef.current = resolveIframe(playerRef.current);
  });

  return <hyperframes-player ref={playerRef} src={src} onLoad={onIframeLoad} />;
}
```

> **Heads up — common gotcha**
>
> If you pass the `<hyperframes-player>` element itself (not `iframeElement`) into a hook that expects an `<iframe>`, every `.contentWindow` / `.contentDocument` access returns `null` because the iframe lives inside the player's Shadow DOM. Always extract `iframeElement` first, or use `resolveIframe` from `@hyperframes/studio` which handles both iframe and web-component hosts transparently.

## Events

| Event                   | Detail                                              | Fired when                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `ready`                 | `{ duration, compositionWidth, compositionHeight }` | Composition loaded and duration determined |
| `durationchange`        | `{ duration }`                                      | The duration changed after `ready`         |
| `resize`                | `{ compositionWidth, compositionHeight }`           | The composition's size changed             |
| `play`                  | —                                                   | Playback started                           |
| `pause`                 | —                                                   | Playback paused                            |
| `timeupdate`            | `{ currentTime }`                                   | Playback position changed (~10 fps)        |
| `ended`                 | —                                                   | Reached the end (when not looping)         |
| `rangeclamped`          | `{ rangeStart, rangeEnd, duration }`                | The range was cut to the film, or ignored  |
| `error`                 | `{ message }` (video mode: `{ message, code }`)     | Composition or video failed to load        |
| `playbackerror`         | `{ source, error }`                                 | The browser blocked playback               |
| `shadertransitionstate` | `{ compositionId, state }`                          | Shader transition cache/capture progress   |

```js
player.addEventListener("ready", (e) => {
  console.log(`Duration: ${e.detail.duration}s`);
});

player.addEventListener("ended", () => {
  console.log("Done!");
});
```

## Sizing

The player fills its container and scales the composition to fit while preserving aspect ratio. Set a size on the element or its parent:

```css
hyperframes-player {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 800px;
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
}
```

The `width` and `height` attributes define the composition's native resolution for aspect ratio calculation — they don't set the player's display size.

## How it works

The player renders compositions in a sandboxed `<iframe>` inside a Shadow DOM. It communicates with the HyperFrames runtime via `postMessage`. If the composition has GSAP timelines (`window.__timelines`) but no runtime, the player auto-injects it from CDN.
