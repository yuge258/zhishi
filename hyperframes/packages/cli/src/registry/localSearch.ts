/**
 * Local catalog search that costs nothing and needs no account.
 *
 * Scoring shared vocabulary answers "make the pace suddenly feel faster"
 * partially, offline, with no model and no network, where a substring test
 * finds nothing because no description contains that phrase.
 *
 * The scorer is the one the retrieval evaluation used: lowercase tokens, stop
 * words dropped, anything two characters or shorter dropped, and the shared
 * token count divided by the square root of the entry's token count. Without
 * that divisor the wordiest entry wins every query on sheer surface area.
 *
 * Two things sit on top of that, both measured against a fixed eval set of
 * catalog queries rather than adjusted by feel:
 *
 * 1. A token matching an item's NAME or TITLE counts for more than one
 *    matching its description, so searching "typewriter effect on a title"
 *    ranks the item called `typewriter` above entries that merely mention
 *    typing. A name the author types is the strongest signal available.
 *
 * 2. Plurals fold to their singular on both sides, so "a stat that counts up
 *    and then pulses once" matches a description reading "lands with a
 *    restrained scale pulse". Adding detail to a query must not make results
 *    worse.
 *
 * Ties break on descending name, matching the evaluation's sort.

 * Reconcile the two spellings of one compound word.
 *
 * The tokenizer splits on word boundaries, so `countdown` is one token and

 * spellings of a single idea return disjoint result sets: `countdown` returned
 * only the one item tagged with that exact word, while `count down timer`
 * returned sixteen that did not include it. Whichever phrasing an author
 * happened to type decided which half of the answer they saw, and neither half
 * was the whole answer.
 *
 * Both directions, and both gated on the catalog's own vocabulary so this can
 * only ever add signal:
 *
 * - A query token is split when both halves are words the catalog actually
 *   uses. The compound is always kept, so nothing is lost: `countdown` is rare
 *   and keeps its high inverse-document-frequency weight, while the common
 *   halves it adds bring in the items written the other way and carry almost
 *   no weight of their own. That is why splitting `typewriter` into `type` and
 *   `writer` cannot dislodge the item literally called typewriter.
 * - Adjacent query tokens are joined when the compound is a word the catalog
 *   actually uses, so `count down` also reaches items written `countdown`.
 *
 * A word in neither form, like `timer` (which appears in none of the catalog's
 * items), is left exactly as it was: this widens phrasing, it does not invent
 * matches.
 *
 * Everything added here is INFERRED rather than asked for, so it carries a
 * fraction of a real token's weight. Without that the inference can outvote the
 * question: `type` matching the name of `type-match-cut` at full strength beats
 * `typewriter` matching the name of `typewriter`, and searching a word returns
 * something that merely contains half of it. Relying on the halves being
 * statistically common in a large catalog is not the same as making them
 * count for less, and only one of the two holds when the corpus is small.
