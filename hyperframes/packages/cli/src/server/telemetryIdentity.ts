// CLI → Studio telemetry identity (Layer 1).
//
// The CLI owns both the Studio launch and the local server, so it seeds the
// browser with its own anonymous `config.anonymousId`. Studio adopts it as its
// distinct_id (see packages/studio/src/telemetry/distinctId.ts), so the CLI's
// `cli_command*` events and the browser's `studio:*` / `studio_*` / render
// events are attributed to one PostHog person.
//
// This uses ONLY the existing anonymous machine id (a random UUID, no PII), so
// the "no personal info" telemetry disclosure stays valid. When CLI telemetry
// is disabled (opt-out / dev / CI / DO_NOT_TRACK) nothing is seeded and Studio
// behaves exactly as if opened standalone.
//
// Kept out of studioServer.ts so it can be unit-tested without pulling in the
// server's heavy render dependencies (@hyperframes/producer, engine, …).
