// Install-state file: ~/.hyperframes/install-state.json
//
// A separate FILE, but deliberately the same DIRECTORY as config.json, so
// `rm -rf ~/.hyperframes` really is a full reset. It previously lived in
// ~/.local/state/hyperframes/ specifically to survive that delete; review
// rejected that ("if someone is deleting their hyperframes config it should
// wipe all hyperframes state — I'm not sure we should try and persist state
// elsewhere to get around this"), and the measurement agreed: the churn this
// actually defends against is not users running `rm -rf`.
//
// The threat it does defend against is config.json itself. That file is hot
// and wide — ~20 fields rewritten on every command and every render — and
// readConfig recovers from ANY parse/permission/IO failure by minting a fresh
// identity. Splitting these two facts into their own file decouples them from
// that churn: no shared schema to migrate on upgrade, and one write at first
// mint instead of one per command.
//
// It carries exactly three facts, and no telemetry identity — no anonymousId,
// no counters, nothing emitted that links the old install to the new one:
//
//   1. `markerAt` — "a hyperframes install existed on this machine". Now that
//      it shares CONFIG_DIR, `predecessorFound` measures the churn we care
//      about (config.json lost, install-state survived => corruption/re-mint)
//      rather than deliberate directory deletion, which takes both.
//   2. `deParallelRouterTrialFired` — the DE parallel-router circuit
//      breaker's tripped state, so a config re-mint does not re-enrol an
//      install into an experimental path that already FAILED on this machine.
//   3. `bucketSeed` — the canary bucketing unit, so a re-mint does not
//      reshuffle cohorts mid-rollout. Never transmitted; only the resulting
//      true/false assignments are. Sharing CONFIG_DIR is what keeps it from
//      being a persistent identifier that outlives the user's reset.
//
// Removal path: delete ~/.hyperframes (or just this file). `hyperframes
// telemetry status` prints its exact location.
