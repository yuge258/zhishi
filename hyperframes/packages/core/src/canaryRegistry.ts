/**
 * The canary registry — every staged rollout in the product, in one file.
 *
 * Why a registry rather than a percentage inlined at each call site: the repo
 * already carries 57 loose `HF_*` / `PRODUCER_*` toggles with no index, so
 * nobody can answer "what is currently rolling out, to how many people, and
 * who owns it" without grepping. One table fixes that, and gives the
 * telemetry and `doctor` surfaces something to enumerate.
 *
 * ## Adding one
 *
 * 1. Add an entry below. Start at `percentage: 0` and merge that — a canary
 *    at 0 is dead code you can land safely and ramp without a code review.
 * 2. Read it at the decision point via the surface's binding (in the CLI,
 *    `isCanaryEnabled("your-feature")`).
 * 3. Ramp by editing `percentage` in a patch release: 0 → 5 → 25 → 100.
 *    Widening is inclusive, so the earlier cohort stays enrolled and the
 *    before/after comparison survives the ramp.
 * 4. At 100 and holding, DELETE the entry and the branch it guarded. That is
 *    the point of `sunsetAfter`.
 *
 * ## Overriding
 *
 * `HF_CANARY_<FEATURE>` with the feature name upper-snake-cased, e.g.
 * `HF_CANARY_DE_PARALLEL_ROUTER=on` (also: off/true/false/1/0/yes/no).
 * An override always wins over the percentage, in both directions.

  // Two INERT canaries that gate nothing. They exist to validate the rollout
  // mechanism against real traffic before anything real depends on it, and
  // they answer questions the synthetic tests cannot:
  //
  //   1. Does a requested percentage land on target in the wild? The unit
  //      tests use generated UUIDs and weight every install equally; real
  //      render volume is heavily skewed toward a few heavy installs, so the
  //      render-weighted share could differ from the install-weighted one.
  //   2. How fast does CUMULATIVE exposure drift above the target? Install
  //      ids churn (measured: 24.7x more distinct ids over 30 days than in
  //      any single day), so the set of installs enrolled AT SOME POINT grows
  //      even though the instantaneous share stays flat. That drift is the
  //      real limit on a canary's blast-radius guarantee.
  //   3. Are two canaries actually independent on real ids, not just on
  //      generated ones? Overlap should be ~p1*p2, not ~min(p1,p2).
  //
  // Two different percentages so the answer is a line, not a point.
  // Delete both once the calibration window is read.
