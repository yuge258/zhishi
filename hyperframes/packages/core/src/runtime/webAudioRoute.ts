/**
 * Which transport may claim an `<audio>` element's output.
 *
 * `createMediaElementSource()` is the runtime's PRIMARY audio path, and it is
 * a one-way door: the node permanently reroutes the element away from its
 * native output and is cached for the element's lifetime. That matters because
 * of a spec behaviour that looks nothing like a failure — per the Web Audio
 * spec's MediaElementAudioSourceNode security section, a node built over a
 * resource that fails the CORS-cross-origin check outputs SILENCE. It does not
 * throw, so the `try/catch` around the call in `webAudioTransport.ts` never
 * fires, nothing reaches `swallow()`, and the composition plays perfectly —
 * timeline advancing, visuals animating — with no audio at all (#3458).
 *
 * The only defence is to decide BEFORE the call, which is what this module is:
 * a pure classifier, so the same verdict can be reached at media-discovery time
 * (to emit a diagnostic) and at schedule time (to actually withhold the node)
 * without those two ever drifting apart.
 *
 * That guarantee holds for every caller that routes through this classifier —
 * it is NOT a runtime-wide interception of `createMediaElementSource`. The
 * timeline transport (`webAudioTransport.ts`, via `init.ts`) always goes
 * through it; a UI surface that builds its own throwaway `AudioContext` for
 * an unrelated purpose (e.g. the asset sidebar's preview player,
 * `AudioRow.tsx`) has to call it too, and is expected to. Known gap: an
 * element playing a `MediaStream` via `srcObject` instead of `src`/`<source>`
 * has no origin for this module to judge — `routeCandidates` only reads
 * `src`-shaped attributes, so a `srcObject` element always reads as
 * `web-audio` here, correctly or not. Nothing in this codebase feeds
 * `createMediaElementSource` from a `srcObject` element today, so this is
 * recorded as a boundary rather than fixed.
 *
 * Second known gap, same shape: `corsSilenceReason` judges the RAW url string —
 * the same-origin URL the author wrote, or whatever the browser resolved into
 * `currentSrc` — not wherever a server-side redirect chain actually lands.
 * A same-origin URL that 302s to a cross-origin CDN reads as `web-audio` here
 * and gets a real `createMediaElementSource` node; whether that node is
 * silent then depends on the redirect target's CORS headers, which this
 * classifier never sees (following the chain to inspect the final response
 * would turn a pure, synchronous verdict — needed on every schedule call —
 * into an async fetch). A cross-origin URL that redirects back to same-origin
 * has the opposite miss: classified `decode-only` and sent down the fetch
 * fallback when Web Audio capture would have worked fine either way. Not
 * fixed for the same reason as `srcObject` — no caller in this codebase
 * routes media through a redirecting URL today — but worth knowing before
 * trusting this classifier's verdict for one that does.
