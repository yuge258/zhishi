/**
 * Reject paths that escape the `base` directory — including via symlinks.
 *
 * `path.resolve()` collapses `.`/`..` but does NOT dereference symlinks, so a
 * plain prefix check (`resolved.startsWith(base + sep)`) can be defeated by a
 * symlink that lives *inside* `base` but points outside it (e.g.
 * `base/link -> /etc`). A downstream `readFileSync`/`writeFileSync`/`statSync`
 * then follows that link to a file outside `base`. To close this we canonicalize
 * both sides with `realpathSync.native` (the on-disk letter case too) before comparing.
 *
 * The target may not exist yet (e.g. creating a new file), so we canonicalize the
 * deepest *existing* ancestor and re-attach the trailing not-yet-existing
 * segments. Segments that don't exist cannot be symlinks at check time, so they
 * can't redirect the path outside `base` right now. (A symlink swapped in between
 * this check and the subsequent fs call is an inherent TOCTOU race this helper
 * does not, and cannot by itself, defend against.)
 *
 * Lives at the package root rather than under `studio-api/` because callers span
 * layers — `studio-api` routes, the `compiler`, the CLI, and the engine — and
 * `compiler` sits below `studio-api` in the dependency graph, so it cannot import
 * from there without a backwards edge.
