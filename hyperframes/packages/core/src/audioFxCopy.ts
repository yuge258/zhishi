/**
 * The plain-language layer over the effect registry.
 *
 * Every entry is written for somebody who has never opened a mixer. The rule
 * used throughout: name the OUTCOME, never the mechanism, and describe a control
 * by what changes in the sound rather than what it does to the signal.
 *
 * This is a layer *over* the registry, not a replacement for it. `HF_AUDIO_FX`
 * stays the authority on what an effect is and what its parameters do; this says
 * what to call those things in front of an author. `audioFxCopy.test.ts` holds
 * the two together — every shipped effect, every one of its parameters, and
 * every preset must have an entry here, so adding one to the registry without
 * copy fails a test rather than shipping a rack panel labelled `highpass`.
 *
 * Tone and the levelling module are deliberately absent: both carry their own
 * copy in core already (`audioEqSummary`, `levellingSummary`), because a summary
 * that has to read the chain belongs beside the code that writes it.
 *
 * Design rationale, and the review page built from this, in
 * `plans/audio-fx-ux/README.md`.
