/**
 * Shown when the currently open composition's file has vanished from disk
 * mid-session — the `absent` read reason (#4325): the file tree listed it and
 * the read cannot get it.
 *
 * Distinct from `ProjectUnreachableBanner`: there the whole PROJECT fails to
 * resolve; here the project is fine and this one file inside it is not. Proven
 * 2026-09-23 to be a stale tree, not a placeholder or a path-encoding gap:
 * `refreshFileTree` only ran after Studio's own file operations, so an agent
 * removing or replacing a composition updated the preview and the SDK session
 * but never the listing — the file stayed clickable, and every edit through
 * it failed silently, with nothing to tell the user why. The tree is now
 * refreshed as soon as this fires (`useSdkSession`'s `onAbsentRead`); this
 * banner is the only thing that explains the failure while that catches up.
