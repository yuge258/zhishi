/**
 * Shown when the running Studio cannot resolve this tab's project id.
 *
 * Why this exists: a tab whose project the server does not serve fails every
 * read with a 404, so every edit silently takes the server path and nothing
 * lands. The user sees a normal-looking editor that does not save. In the
 * CLI-embedded host — the only host that reports telemetry, since
 * `telemetry/policy.ts` suppresses Vite dev — the cause is almost always that
 * this Studio is serving a *different* project: `hyperframes preview` reuses
 * port 3002, so starting it on another folder takes the port from under an
 * open tab, and the project it was pointed at is untouched on disk.
 *
 * The wording is deliberately narrower than "this project is gone". We can see
 * which project this server serves; we cannot see why it does not serve this
 * one, and nothing here is lost. See
 * `docs/hyperframes/plans/sdk/2026-09-20-stale-project-id-remaining-doors-plan.md` §C.
