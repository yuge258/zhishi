/**
 * Styling a run of characters inside an element being edited in place.
 *
 * Not `document.execCommand`. That is deprecated, and what it emits varies by
 * browser between `<font>`, a class, and an inline style depending on
 * `styleWithCSS`. The output of this goes into the user's composition file, so
 * it has to be one predictable shape, and the shape is a `<span>` carrying an
 * inline style.
 *
 * Not DOM range surgery either, which is the obvious way and the wrong one.
 * Wrapping a range in a span is three lines and then every interesting case is
 * a special case: recolouring nests spans that shadow each other, removing a
 * style cannot reach the ancestor that set it, and styling across an existing
 * run's boundary has to split it. Each fix is a new branch and the branches
 * interact.
 *
 * So the element is read into a flat list of styled runs, the styling is
 * applied to a span of characters in that list, and the element is rebuilt
 * from it. Replacing, removing, splitting and merging all stop being cases:
 * the rebuild emits one span per distinct run and cannot nest or duplicate,
 * whatever was there before. Text elements in a composition are a headline or
 * a sentence, so reading and rebuilding one is not a cost worth avoiding.
