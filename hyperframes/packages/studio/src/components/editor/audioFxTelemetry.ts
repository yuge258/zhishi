/**
 * What the audio FX rack reports about itself.
 *
 * One module rather than `trackStudioEvent` calls scattered through six
 * components, for two reasons. The event names and property shapes have to
 * agree across the panel or a dashboard cannot join them — and everything here
 * is subject to one rule that is easy to break a callsite at a time:
 *
 * **Nothing user-authored leaves the browser.** Not element ids, not media
 * filenames, not composition paths, not chain JSON. Every property below is
 * either a fixed identifier from our own catalogue (a preset id, an effect
 * type, a parameter key), a number, or a boolean. `studioTelemetry.ts` already
 * strips the query string off `url_hash` for exactly this reason — the ids in
 * it are the author's own. The rack sees the same class of data and must hold
 * the same line.
 *
 * The second rule is about volume: **commit, not preview.** Every control in
 * the rack has a preview path that fires continuously while a slider moves and
 * a commit path that fires once when it is released. Only the commit path
 * belongs here. Wiring a param event to the preview would emit tens of events
 * per drag, which is both a cost and a lie — an author who nudges a knob and
 * puts it back did not make thirty decisions.

/**
 * What arrived on a composition that this session did not put there.

 * fix a mix does not drive the panel — it edits the composition HTML, or runs
 * `scripts/carve.mjs`, and the rack simply finds the result already present.
 * None of the events above will ever fire for that work.
 *
 * So the panel reports the shape of what it was handed, and how many edits this
 * session had made when it appeared. Fx that changed while the studio was open
 * with `panel_edits` unmoved was written by something else — which, combined
 * with `agent_runtime` on the same event, is as close to "an agent did this" as
 * the browser can honestly get.
 *
 * `first_sight` distinguishes opening a composition that already had effects
 * from watching effects appear in one that did not.
