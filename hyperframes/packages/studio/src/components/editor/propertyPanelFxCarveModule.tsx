 * The carve, as one module in the rack.

 * A carve is one thing the author switched on; the peaking filters and the level
 * stage are how it is built. Listed individually they read as hand-built effects —
 * removable one at a time, reorderable, each with knobs the next strength change
 * silently overwrites. So the rack shows the unit, and the unit owns everything
 * that means anything for it: which voice it listens to, how hard it works,
 * whether it follows that voice, and what the analysis made of it.
 *
 * The controls used to sit in their own block under the rack, which read as a
 * second, unrelated feature that happened to produce effects somewhere else. One
 * card, controls above the analysis they drive, is the same thing said once.
 *
 * Grouped is not hidden. Opening it lists every effect inside with all of its
 * settings, because an author has to be able to see where the analysis landed — as
 * readouts rather than controls, since strength is what sets them and a knob here
 * would be overwritten by the next adjustment.
