/**
 * Incremental memory for `collectDomEditLayerItems`.
 *
 * The layer walk is re-run from scratch every time a MutationObserver says the
 * preview changed, and the observer's loudest source is inline `style` — which
 * is exactly what animation writes. So a paused-looking editor re-derived every
 * element's patch target, label and child count several times a second, and each
 * derivation costs two `getComputedStyle` reads (its own plus one per direct
 * child), two ancestor walks for the source file, and a `textContent` read whose
 * cost is the element's whole subtree.
 *
 * None of that depends on the traversal — only on the element. So the traversal
 * stays live (it is pointer-chasing, and `depth` genuinely is positional) and the
 * per-element half is memoized, with the mutation records deciding what to drop.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES A CACHED ENTRY WRONG, and how each is caught:
 *
 *   - the element's own attributes (`style` -> computed display, `class`/`id`/
 *     `data-hf-group` -> selector and label)        -> attribute record on it
 *   - an ancestor's `visibility`, the ONLY inherited input to the
 *     display/visibility gate (`display:none` on an ancestor does not change a
 *     descendant's own computed `display`)          -> attribute record on the
 *                                                      ancestor, whose subtree is
 *                                                      dropped only when the
 *                                                      style declares visibility
 *   - a direct child appearing or disappearing from the layer list, which moves
 *     the parent's `childCount`                     -> the parent is dropped
 *                                                      alongside every element
 *   - descendant text, which moves an ancestor's label -> characterData record,
 *                                                      ancestors dropped
 *   - selector occurrence indices, which shift for EVERY element sharing a
 *     selector when one element's identity changes  -> whole cache dropped
 *   - nodes added or removed, which shift indices, order, labels and counts at
 *     once and cannot be attributed to one element  -> whole cache dropped
 *   - a different active composition path, or a new composition-id -> source-file
 *     map, both of which re-scope every source file -> checked per walk
 *
 * The bias is deliberate and matches the duration cache in the runtime: a
 * redundant recomputation is a missed optimisation, a missed one is a wrong
 * layer tree.
