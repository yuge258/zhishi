/**
 * The shared frequency ruler.
 *
 * Frequencies mean nothing to somebody who has not been taught them, and the
 * rack speaks entirely in them. `BANDS` names the ranges in the words the same
 * person would use unprompted — rumble, weight, mud, middle, presence, edge,
 * air — and every spectral module shows where it acts on this one ruler, so
 * naming them once teaches them everywhere they appear.
 *
 * Two things at once, deliberately. The bar says where this module works
 * relative to everything else, which is the spatial fact; the caption under it
 * names the range and what lives there, which is the vocabulary. A bar alone
 * would be decoration and a caption alone would not teach the shape.
 *
 * Log-spaced, because hearing is: 20–200 Hz is as much of the range to an ear as
 * 2–20 kHz, and a linear ruler would crush six of the seven bands into a corner.
