/**
 * This is the only way agent-applied effects become visible. An agent asked to
 * fix a mix does not drive this panel — it edits the composition HTML, or runs
 * `scripts/carve.mjs`, and the rack simply finds the work already done. Not
 * one of the panel's own events fires for any of it.
 *
 * So: watch the chain's shape, and report it when it changes without a panel
 * edit behind it. `panelEdits` is the discriminator — this session's own
 * writes bump it, so a chain that moved while the counter stood still moved
 * because something outside the studio moved it.
 *
 * Keyed on the shape rather than fired once per mount: a soft reload after an
 * agent edits the file re-mounts this component, and a mount-only event would
 * either miss the change or double-count every HMR. Comparing the fingerprint
 * reports real changes and stays quiet through both.
 *
 * Returns a wrapped `onSetAttributeQuiet` that every other write in the panel
 * must go through instead of the raw prop: the count is only meaningful if it
 * is exhaustive, and a write added later that forgot to route through here
 * would silently start reporting the author's own edits as having come from
 * outside.
