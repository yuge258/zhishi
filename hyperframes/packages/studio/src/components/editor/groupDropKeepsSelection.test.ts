/**
 * A group drag ended by deselecting the group it had just moved.
 *
 * Every pointerup trails a click. The gesture ref is cleared before the commit,
 * so by the time that click arrives the box no longer looks busy and it reaches
 * the canvas as an ordinary click — landing in the gap between the members,
 * resolving to nothing, and clearing the selection. Captured live as a
 * `[hf-select] clear` with `hadGroup: 3` two milliseconds after the drop.
 *
 * The under-threshold path already ate that click; the committed path has to as
 * well, and the flag is set before the two diverge so neither can forget.
