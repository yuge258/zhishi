 *
 * A structural child keeps an element out: those are separate text fields, the
 * panel edits them one at a time, and making the whole element editable would
 * flatten them into a single string.
 *
 * A formatting child does not. Styling a run of characters puts a span inside
 * the element, so a rule of "no element children" would have let the editor
 * lock every element it had ever styled out of itself, permanently, on the
 * first colour change. What counts as formatting is the sanitiser's allowlist,
 * so the editor and the thing that writes the file agree on it.
