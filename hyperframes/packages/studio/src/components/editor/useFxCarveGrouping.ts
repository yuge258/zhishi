 * existed since it was written and had no caller; this is the half nothing
 * asked, and without it a narration clip was offered the control and, finding
 * exactly one candidate, had a carve applied against the group it belonged to.
 *
 * `autoBed` — may one be applied WITHOUT the author asking? Stricter. Showing
 * the module on a track named `a1` is a suggestion; writing `data-fx-carve`
 * onto it is a decision, and a decision taken off a name that said nothing is
 * how a carve turns up that nobody remembers configuring. The same split the
 * source side already makes between what the picker may show (`sourceOptions`)
 * and what it may choose unprompted (`autoSourceIds`).
