/**
 * Whether a keystroke is going somewhere the user is typing.
 *
 * Every keyboard shortcut in Studio has to ask this before claiming a key, and
 * they were each asking it slightly differently. The version that matched
 * `[contenteditable='true']` missed `contenteditable="plaintext-only"`, which
 * is what inline text editing uses, so the playback shortcuts kept claiming
 * letters out of it: `a` seeked to the in-point and `e` to the out-point,
 * `preventDefault` and all, and the character never reached the text.
 *
 * `isContentEditable` is the property to ask, not the attribute to match: it is
 * true for every editable value and for an element made editable by an
 * ancestor, which an attribute selector on the target alone cannot see.
 * The wider input gate is deliberate too: checkboxes and readonly fields own
 * Space and arrow keys even when they do not accept text.
