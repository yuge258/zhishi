 * Unshared, each call runs its own whole-document `querySelectorAll(selector)`
 * and resolves the source file of every match. A rebuild that walks n elements
 * sharing a selector therefore does n whole-document queries and n² resolver
 * calls — a composition of repeated cards or tiles is exactly that shape. One
 * index per selector makes the same pass linear.
 *
 * Correctness rests on the pass being ONE synchronous walk of a document that
 * does not change under it: nothing invalidates the index, so `run` must not
 * mutate `doc`, and every call inside it must resolve source files the same way
 * (the resolver may be a fresh closure per call, as long as it answers the
 * same). Outside a pass the index is per-call, exactly as before.
