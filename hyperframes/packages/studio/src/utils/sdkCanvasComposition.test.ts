/**
 * linkedom's HTMLCanvasElement constructor calls `createCanvas(300, 150)` from
 * the Node-only `canvas` package. linkedom guards that import in a try/catch —
 * try the native package, fall back to its own bundled shim — but a bundler
 * resolves the require statically, so the catch never fires in the browser
 * build and `createCanvas` lands undefined. Parsing any `<canvas>` tag then
 * throws, `openComposition` rejects, and Studio silently loses its SDK session
 * for the whole composition (no cutover, and the resolver shadow does not run
 * either).
 *
 * Production telemetry, 72h after the v0.8.47 flip: 1065 of 1544
 * `studio:sdk_session_unavailable` events were this crash, spread across a
 * large share of 197 users. Canvas is common in compositions — Three.js,
 * shaders, particle effects, charts.
 *
 * The fix is a `resolve.alias` in the studio's vite config pointing `canvas` at
 * linkedom's own shim. This test pins the behaviour the alias has to preserve.
