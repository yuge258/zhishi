/**
 * `createContext`, but stable across Vite HMR re-evaluations.
 *
 * A module-scope `createContext()` mints a NEW context object every time its
 * module is re-evaluated. HMR re-evaluates modules one at a time, so a context
 * module can be replaced while the components consuming it still hold the old
 * object — the provider then fills context A while the consumer reads context
 * B, gets `null`, and a `useX must be used within an XProvider` guard throws.
 *
 * The symptom is unmistakable and misleading: the React component stack shows
 * the consumer nested INSIDE the very provider it claims to be missing. It
 * crashed the studio on edits to files nowhere near the context — anything that
 * propagated an HMR boundary up to it was enough.
 *
 * Keying the context on `globalThis` by a stable name makes the second
 * evaluation reuse the first object, so old and new modules agree. Production
 * builds evaluate once, where this is an ordinary `createContext` with a map
 * lookup in front of it.
