/**
 * Why an optional project-file read produced no usable content. `stage: "read"`
 * was a single opaque reason covering all of these, which made the largest
 * remaining class of SDK-session failures undiagnosable: 56 users in a 7-day
 * window hit it and, between them, never landed a single successful SDK edit.
 * Knowing which branch fired is the difference between "the file legitimately
 * is not there" and "the request never reached the file".
 *
 * Every reason lives in this union so the full surface is readable from one
 * place — `absent_or_empty` included, even though it is a 2xx.
 *
 * `network` is a fetch that REJECTED — the request never produced a response.
 * It was not in this union until 2026-09-21, so it escaped `readProjectFileOptional`
 * and was caught by the effect's outer `.catch`, landing in `stage: "open"`.
 * That label means `openComposition` threw (unparseable composition, OOM), and
 * it is what the largest failure class was reported as. Every `stage: open`
 * event measured on 0.8.56 and 0.8.57 carries a fetch-rejection message —
 * "Failed to fetch", "Load failed", "NetworkError when attempting to fetch
 * resource." — so the class was a network problem filed under a parser one, and
 * unaddressable in that bucket.
 *
 * `network` carries `elapsedMs` (time from fetch start to rejection) and
 * `hidden` (`document.visibilityState` at the moment of rejection) because
 * "the fetch rejected" alone conflates two very different situations: a
 * closing tab or a server that exited under a live one (rejects after a real
 * delay, `hidden` often true by the time it lands) versus a request blocked
 * before it left the browser — CSP `connect-src`, Private Network Access, an
 * extension rewriting `fetch` (rejects near-instantly, tab stays visible and
 * alive). Telemetry before this change could not tell the two apart.
 *
 * `absent` and `empty_file` split what `absent_or_empty` could not: the route
 * answers `content: ""` both for a file it cannot find (the `optional=1` shim)
 * and for a real 0-byte one, so the single label covered a composition nobody
 * has written yet AND a path that does not resolve on this server. The route
 * now marks the shim with `missing: true`. A server without that field still
 * lands in `absent_or_empty`, so the old series stays honest rather than
 * silently folding into one of the new ones.
 *
 * Measured on 0.8.62 before the split: 75 tabs hit this class and not one of
 * them ever landed an SDK edit afterwards — it is terminal for the tab, while
 * the tab itself keeps playing back and navigating, so nothing surfaces.
 *
 * `invalid_json` is a 200 whose body is not JSON at all — in production, an
 * HTML page (`Unexpected token '<', "<!-- /*!"...`), i.e. an SPA fallback or a
 * proxy answering in the route's place. `res.json()` rejected outside any
 * catch until now, so it escaped this function and the effect's outer catch
 * filed it as `stage: "open"` — which asserts the COMPOSITION failed to parse.
 * Third label to make that same wrong claim, after `network` (#4240) and the
 * fetch-rejection split; this one is the response shape, not the composition.
