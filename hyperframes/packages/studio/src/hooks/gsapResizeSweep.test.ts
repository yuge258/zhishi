/**
 * Every shape of animated element a composition can hand the resize, swept.
 *
 * Both faults this branch fixes were found one composition at a time, which is
 * a bad way to find the third. So this drives the real intercept across the
 * cross-product of what an element's tweens can look like and holds every run
 * to the two rules that were broken:
 *
 *   1. Never address an animation the source does not have. Sending a stale id
 *      is what "animation not found" is, and it leaves the element unsavable.
 *   2. Never leave a tween spanning two property groups. The parser classifies
 *      such a tween as neither, so it loses its group suffix and its id along
 *      with it, and every later edit has nothing to address.
 *
 * The server stand-in answers the way the real one does — an id it cannot find
 * is a rejection — and applies what it is told, so a run that corrupts the
 * animation list is caught by the next mutation in the same run rather than by
 * a person noticing weeks later.
