 * an envelope afterwards writes to the preview document and the source file, and the
 * store would go on holding the value it was born with until a reload.
 *
 * One reader, called where a change lands: the resync every dom-edit attribute
 * commit runs, and an undo or redo's soft restore (timeline saves record their own
 * value through syncStoredElementAttribute below). It
 * reads the preview rather than being told, because those callers know a file
 * changed, not which attribute — and because three separate writers shipped without
 * remembering to sync, which is what a single sink prevents.

 * — but the store it does not touch is the one the lanes read, so an undone delete
 * stayed invisible until a reload. A full restore already clears the store and waits
