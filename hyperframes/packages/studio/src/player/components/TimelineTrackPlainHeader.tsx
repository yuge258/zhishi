            sitting in the eye's slot. `visible={false}` rather than omitting the

            EXCEPT when the audio track is ALREADY hidden. Withholding the
            control unconditionally withheld the only way back: `data-hidden`
            silences the clip in preview and drops it from the render, the
            panel's "Muted" is the unrelated HTML `muted` attribute, and nothing
            else writes it — so a track hidden before this rule (or by "Hide
            all", or by hand) was silent with no control anywhere to restore it.
            Offering the eye only in that state keeps the affordance off a normal
            audio row while leaving the door open from the inside. */}
