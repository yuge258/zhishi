/**
 * Make a component's catalog preview answer its variables panel.
 *
 * A component ships two HTML files. The snippet is what the page hands you to
 * paste: it carries `data-composition-variables`, a script that turns a chosen
 * value into a CSS custom property, and CSS written against those properties.
 * `demo.html` stages that component against a background and registers the
 * GSAP timeline that makes the preview move.
 *
 * The catalog preview is built from the demo, and the demo is a hand-authored
 * copy rather than a reference. The copies drifted: of the 168 components that
 * declare variables, 166 demos have no declaration and no reader, so the
 * preview renders constants and the panel cannot move it whatever is picked.
 *
 * There is no single repair, because components come in two shapes. See
 * `snippetOwnsItsMotion` for the split and how it was established. This module
 * handles the shape where the demo owns the motion: it keeps the demo's markup
 * and timeline and layers on the three things the copy lost.
 *
 *   1. the declaration, copied verbatim from the snippet's root
 *   2. the snippet's `<style>`, appended so its var()-driven rules win on
 *      document order over the demo's hardcoded copies
 *   3. the snippet's `<script>`, which sets the properties that CSS reads
 *
 * Nothing in the demo's DOM is moved or rewritten, which is what keeps the
 * animation intact.

/**

 * Components come in two shapes and the preview has to be built differently

 * GSAP timeline: those are whole pieces, and the preview is best built from the
 * snippet, which then carries markup, variables and motion together. The other
 * 45 are markup plus a commented recipe, and it is the demo that animates them,
 * so those keep the demo and have the variable machinery layered on.
 *
 * Getting this backwards is not subtle. Build a self-contained component from
 * its demo with the snippet layered on and it keeps rendering its defaults;
 * build a recipe-only one from its snippet and the preview holds still. Both
 * were observed before this split existed.
 *
 * Comments are stripped first, because the recipe is written as one.
